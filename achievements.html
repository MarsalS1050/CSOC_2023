                    <h3>Chandrayaan-1</h3>
                    <p>Chandrayaan 1 as India's first lunar probe. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation on 22 October 2008, and was operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. </p>

                    <h3>Chandrayaan-2</h3>
                    <p>Chandrayaan-2 was launched from the second launch pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 22 July 2019 at 2.43 PM IST (09:13 UTC) to the Moon by a LVM3 (previously known as GSLV Mk III). The planned orbit has a perigee of 169.7 km and an apogee of 45475 km. It consists of a lunar orbiter, lander and rover, all developed in India. The main scientific objective is to map the location and abundance of lunar water. </p>

                    <h3>Mars Orbiter Mission</h3>
                    <p>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan, is a spacecraft orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). It is India's first interplanetary spaceflight mission and ISRO has become the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency. India is the first Asian nation to reach Mars orbit, and the first nation in the world to do so in its first attempt </p>

                    <h3>ASTROSAT</h3>
                    <p>ASTROSAT is the first dedicated Indian Astronomy satellite mission launched by ISRO on 28 September 2015, which enabled multi-wavelength observations of the celestial bodies and cosmic sources in X-ray and UV spectral bands simultaneously. It was in the Sun's orbit for 7 years. The scientific payloads cover the Visible (3500 – 6000 Å), UV (1300 – op Å), soft and hard X-ray regimes (0.5–8 keV; 3–80 keV). The uniqueness of ASTROSAT lies in its wide spectral coverage extending over visible, UV, soft and hard X-ray regions</p>

                    <h3>Chandrayaan-3</h3>
                    <p>Chandrayaan-3 was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota on 14 July 2023 at 14:35 IST (UTC +5:30) by LVM3 M4. The main scientific objective is to map the location and abundance of lunar water. It is without orbiter. Chandrayaan-2 orbiter helped Chandrayaan-3. The Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on moon on 23/08/2023 at 18:05 (6:05PM).
