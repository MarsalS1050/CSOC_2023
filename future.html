            was India's second interplanetary mission by ISRO, 
            initially planned for launch in 2021-2022. Originally, 
            ISRO chairman K. Sivan mentioned the possibility of including a lander and a rover, 
            but it was later confirmed to be an orbiter mission only.</p>

        <p class="animate">"Gaganyaan" is India's crewed orbital spacecraft,
             part of the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme.
              It's designed for three crew members and will eventually have rendezvous and docking capabilities. 
              The maiden crewed mission, originally planned for December 2021, has been postponed to at least 2025. The capsule, weighing 5.3 metric tons, will orbit Earth at 400 km for up to seven days. The crew module, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), had its first uncrewed test flight in December 2014, with the design completed by May 2019. 
              The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will support critical human-centric systems and technologies, including space-grade food, crew healthcare, radiation protection, parachutes for safe module recovery, and fire suppression systems.</p>

        <p class="animate">The Venus Orbiter Mission, also known as Shukrayaan, is an upcoming mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) aimed at studying Venus' surface and atmosphere. Funding was allocated in 2017 for preliminary studies and instrument solicitations.
             The orbiter will have a science payload capacity of around 100 kilograms with 500 W of available power.
             It will enter an initial elliptical orbit around Venus with periapsis at 500 km and apoapsis at 60,000 km.</p>
