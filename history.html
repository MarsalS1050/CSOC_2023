                        <li>Later in 1972, a space commission and Department of Space (DoS) were set up to oversee space technology development in India specifically.</li>
                        <li>ISRO was brought under DoS, institutionalising space research in India and forging the Indian space programme into its existing form</li>
                        <li>India joined the Soviet Interkosmos programme for space cooperation and got its first satellite <b>Aryabhatta</b> in orbit through a Soviet rocket.</li>

                    <ul><li>PSLV arrival in the 1990s greatly boosted the Indian space program.</li>
                        <li>PSLV had a streak of over 50 successful flights, launching low Earth orbit and GTO satellites.</li>
                        <li>GSLV development was underway alongside PSLV.</li>
                        <li>India initially attempted to acquire cryogenic engines from Russia but faced US opposition.</li>
                        <li>Imported KVD-1 engines from Russia under a limited success agreement.</li>
                        <li><b>Indigenous cryogenic technology</b> development began in 1994, taking two decades to succeed.</li>
                        <li>A new agreement with Russia secured seven KVD-1 cryogenic stages with no tech transfer.</li>
                        <li>These engines were used for initial GSLV Mk.1 flights.</li>
                        <li>ISRO faced US sanctions from May 6, 1992, to May 6, 1994.</li>
